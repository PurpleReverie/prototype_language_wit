# Wit — Overview Agent Memory

Persistent codebase knowledge maintained across task boundaries (per RULES.md rule 4).
This file is the overview agent's working memory; implementer/reviewer agents do not read it directly — they receive task briefings derived from it.

---

## Project goal

Wit is a prose-first markup language for writers and the systems that consume their writing. v1.0 ships: (1) a zero-dependency TypeScript parser library that emits a typed, source-located AST; (2) a small runtime (resolver + expander) that binds references and inlines definitions; (3) a reference HTML renderer; (4) a VS Code extension with minimal LSP; (5) a `.wit` fixture corpus that doubles as the executable spec; (6) docs (spec PDF, narrative examples, intro guide). The spec PDF (`wit-spec.pdf`) is the canonical reference; `examples/` pressure-tests the syntax.

---

## Architecture — 5-stage pipeline (PLAN section C)

```
source string
   -> Lexer       tokens with source locations
   -> Parser      raw AST (invocations unresolved)
   -> Resolver    bound AST (every @x linked to its #x)
   -> Expander    expanded AST (definitions inlined; if/each evaluated)
   -> Renderer    output (HTML / JSON / typeset / game tree)
```

Each stage is independently testable and replaceable. Every AST node carries `{ file, line, col, length }`. Tools that only need structure (LSP, formatter) stop after Parser or Resolver.

---

## Planned module layout (PLAN section L)

```
packages/
  parser/         lexer.ts, parser.ts, ast.ts, errors.ts, index.ts
  runtime/        resolver.ts, expander.ts, lh.ts, index.ts
  render-html/    reference renderer
  vscode/         extension + LSP (server/, client/, syntaxes/)
  cli/            wit build / wit parse / wit check
tests/
  fixtures/       00-lexical/ ... 17-combinations/  (.wit + .json snapshot pairs)
  integration/    whole-document tests
  errors/         .wit + .err.json pairs
  runner/         workspace member; snapshot.ts, walk.ts (planned)
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Note: PLAN.md section L originally called for `tests/runner/vitest.config.ts`. M0 overrode this — vitest config now lives at repo root. See "Scaffold notes" below.

## Conventions

- **Language:** TypeScript, `strict: true`, ESM only (no CJS).
- **Package manager:** pnpm@9.15.9 workspaces. Node 20 in CI.
- **Test runner:** vitest, snapshot-based. `pnpm test` / `pnpm test --update`.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions on push/PR: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` -> `pnpm typecheck` -> `pnpm test` -> `pnpm build`.
- **Versioning:** Changesets; pre-1.0 = 0.x.
- **File size:** under 350 lines (RULES rule 1). Approaching the limit is a signal to extract.
- **Function size:** 20 lines (RULES rule 2). Use local helpers named for intent.
- **Parser package:** zero `dependencies` field per DS-18 (lint-checked).
- **Determinism:** sorted key iteration; same input -> same AST (DS-19).
- **Errors:** `WitError { code, message, loc }` with stable codes (`E_UNCLOSED_NODE`, etc).
- **AST:** serializable JSON, no cycles by structure (resolver uses handles, not pointers).

## File index (existing repo state)

Root:
- `/README.md` — project blurb + table of example files.
- `/PLAN.md` — comprehensive plan: vision, architecture, milestones M0–M7, user stories, dev stories DS-1..DS-21, TDD stories, open questions I.1–I.17, file layout, ops.
- `/RULES.md` — programming rules: file <350 lines, function <20 lines, per-task two-agent loop, overview agent (this), tester agent gating merge.
- `/wit-spec.pdf` — canonical language spec.
- `/cspell.json` — spellcheck config.
- `/package.json` — root workspace; pnpm@9.15.9; devDeps `@types/node ^20.14.0`, `typescript ^5.5.4`, `vitest ^2.0.5`; scripts `test`/`typecheck`/`build`.
- `/pnpm-workspace.yaml` — workspace members: `packages/*`, `tests/runner`.
- `/pnpm-lock.yaml` — frozen lockfile (CI uses `--frozen-lockfile`).
- `/tsconfig.json` — root solution tsconfig; `strict`, ES2022, ESNext modules, Bundler resolution, `noEmit: true`, references `./packages/parser`.
- `/vitest.config.ts` — root vitest config; `include` covers `tests/{fixtures,integration,errors}/**/*.test.ts` and `packages/**/*.test.ts`.
- `/.gitignore` — `node_modules`, `dist`, `.DS_Store`, `*.tsbuildinfo`.

Examples (narrative one-feature-per-file):
- `/examples/01-prose.wit` ... `/examples/17-scripting.wit`, incl. dirs `15-references/`, `16-additive-partials/`.

Packages:
- `/packages/parser/package.json` — `@wit/parser`, private, ESM, exports `./dist/index.js`. **No `dependencies` field** (DS-18).
- `/packages/parser/tsconfig.json` — extends root; `composite: true`, `noEmit: false`, `rootDir: ./src`, `outDir: ./dist`, declarations + maps on.
- `/packages/parser/src/index.ts` — `export * from './ast.js';` (note `.js` extension for ESM resolution of `.ts` source).
- `/packages/parser/src/ast.ts` — placeholder `export {};` to be populated in M1.

Tests:
- `/tests/runner/package.json` — `@wit/test-runner`, exists only to satisfy pnpm workspaces; no source yet.

CI/tooling:
- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `ubuntu-latest`, `pnpm/action-setup@v4`, Node 20 with pnpm cache; runs install/typecheck/test/build.
- `/.claude/settings.local.json` — Claude Code local settings.
- `/.agent-state/overview.md` — THIS FILE.

## Open design questions (PLAN section I)

To be resolved during M1 (fixture-writing forces ambiguities to surface):

1. Are comments AST nodes or fully elided?
2. Single newline within a paragraph — collapse to space, or preserve as soft break?
3. Where can `@name.field` access appear — only in statements/params, or also in body prose?
4. Parameter values — always unquoted, or quoted for special chars?
5. Numeric literals in records — distinguished type or strings?
6. Bare reference vs prose: where does `@weil` end? Whitespace? Punctuation?
7. `!!` greedy-parse risk in body prose — context-only, always-reserved (`\!!` escape), or position-restricted?
8. Forward references — `@x` before `#x`? Lean yes (hoisted).
9. Definition scope — file-local or merged across references? Lean global within ref graph.
10. `lh.set(...)` immutability — mutate AST or layered overlay?
11. Mixing parens and pipes on same node — error or merge?
12. Multi-word flags via parens: `@badge(full width!)` — whole flag or single word?
13. `@scriptCall(fn)` — builtin or generic? Calling convention?
14. Source locations across additive partials — file-tagged child nodes?
15. Indentation in records/collections — required for multi-line or cosmetic?
16. Short-close `!!`: inline-only, or block-allowed?
17. Combining `!!` close with parens (`@name(p,q) body !!`) — allowed?

## Tasks completed

- **Task 1 — M0 scaffold** (merge `8eec37e`): TS monorepo scaffold landed; `pnpm install/typecheck/test/build` all green. pnpm workspace with `packages/parser` (empty AST placeholder) and `tests/runner` workspace stub; root tsconfig solution file with project reference to parser; root vitest config; GitHub Actions CI on Node 20. Ready to receive fixture and parser code.

---

## Scaffold notes for future implementers

- **Vitest config lives at repo root** (`/vitest.config.ts`), NOT under `tests/runner/`. PLAN.md section L's intended location was overridden because vitest auto-discovery from `pnpm test` at the root needed the config visible there. The `include` array in this file is the source of truth for test discovery; new test directories must be added there. Do not "fix" this back to `tests/runner/`.
- **`tests/runner/package.json` exists only to satisfy pnpm workspaces.** No source code yet. When snapshot helpers (`snapshot.ts`, `walk.ts`) land, they can go here, but tests themselves live under `tests/fixtures|integration|errors/`.
- **`packages/parser` has zero `dependencies`** — DS-18 mandate. Adding any runtime dep is a deliberate, reviewer-flagged decision. devDependencies are fine (and currently absent; the package inherits tsc/vitest from root).
- **`dist/` is gitignored.** `tsc --build` emits there via the parser's `composite: true` tsconfig. Root tsconfig has `noEmit: true`; only project-referenced packages emit.
- **ESM resolution quirk:** parser source uses `.js` extensions in imports (e.g. `export * from './ast.js'`) even though the source files are `.ts`. This is the standard NodeNext/Bundler ESM pattern — preserve it in new files.
- **Versions pinned:** pnpm@9.15.9 via `packageManager`; Node 20 in CI; TypeScript ^5.5.4; vitest ^2.0.5. Use the same in any new tooling.
- **`pnpm test` uses `--passWithNoTests`** — currently green with zero tests. Adding a single failing test will surface immediately in CI.
- **Project references:** root `tsconfig.json` references `./packages/parser`. New packages must (a) get their own `composite: true` tsconfig and (b) be added to root's `references` array, or `pnpm typecheck` will skip them.

## Notes for next briefing cycle

- **M1.00 — write fixtures for `tests/fixtures/00-lexical/`** is the next dispatch. Implementer should be briefed to:
  - Read `/wit-spec.pdf` and `/examples/01-prose.wit` first for lexical-layer grounding.
  - Add a `00-lexical.test.ts` (or similar) under `tests/fixtures/00-lexical/` so the existing root `vitest.config.ts` `include` glob picks it up — no config change needed.
  - Treat each `.wit` + `.json` fixture pair as the executable spec; snapshot helpers will be needed (likely in `tests/runner/`).
  - Fixture authoring is expected to surface and resolve design questions I.1–I.17; record decisions back to PLAN.md and bump spec to v0.2.
- Keep this file under 250 lines. Prune resolved design questions into a separate "Decisions" section once they land.
